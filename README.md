# School of Code Help-Dev Ticketing System

## Overview

The School of Code Help-Dev Ticketing System is a collaborative platform designed to facilitate the submission and resolution of "help" tickets within the School of Code community. This project was developed over a 2-day sprint using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## How did we include Next Js features?
Use of image components and font imports for optimization.
Use of next file based routing - use of Link components. 
Use of as many server components as possible to increase performance.
Held components that were fetching data in suspense boundaries to improve user experience for those with slower devices. 
Generated dynamic pages based on user Id.

## Features

- **Ticket Submission:**
  - Users can submit help tickets, detailing their concerns or questions.
  - Each ticket is assigned a unique ticket ID for tracking.

- **Collaborative Resolution:**
  - Coaches and bootcampers can collaborate on addressing submitted tickets.
  - The system promotes a supportive environment for knowledge sharing.
  - STRETCH GOAL: to implement a change of the status of the ticket for when it is in review and it is closed.

- **React and Next.js Integration:**
  - The project leverages the benefits of React for efficient component-based UI development.
  - Next.js is used for server-side rendering, optimizing performance and SEO.

- **Jest Testing:**
  - Testing was a stretch goal and will be the next thing to be implemented with Jest.

- **Tailwind CSS Styling:**
  - Tailwind CSS was adopted for a streamlined and utility-first approach to styling.
  - The use of Tailwind allowed for rapid development without compromising design flexibility.

## Learning Experience

Throughout the development process, the team delved into previously unfamiliar technologies, including Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The learning experience was enriched by collaborative efforts, with team members supporting each other to understand and implement new concepts.

## Acknowledgments

We extend our gratitude to the School of Code for providing an environment that encourages continuous learning and collaborative development. Special thanks to the entire team for their dedication and support during this project.
